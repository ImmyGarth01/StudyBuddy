**StudyBuddy**

**Project Overview**

Relatively, StudyBuddy is a web-based application focused on building a supportive academic community for university students. 

The project aims to help students find suitable study partners, stay motivated, and develop consistent study habits through collaboration rather than competition or financial incentives.

The platform allows users to browse subjects, view other students studying similar courses, and connect based on shared academic interests and study availability. By encouraging peer-to-peer interaction, StudyBuddy helps reduce isolation and makes studying a more social and engaging experience.

A core feature of the application is the study streak system, which tracks consecutive days of study activity. This feature is designed to motivate students to remain consistent and accountable, while also providing a simple visual representation of personal progress.

Overall, the application reflects the principles of sharing and community building by enabling students to exchange time, support, and knowledge to improve their academic outcomes together.
