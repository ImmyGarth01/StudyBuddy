StudyBuddy
Project Overview

StudyBuddy is a community-oriented web application developed to support university students in forming productive study partnerships and sustaining consistent academic engagement. The system addresses common challenges faced by students, including academic isolation, reduced motivation, and difficulty identifying suitable peers for collaborative study.

The application enables users to discover and connect with other students studying similar subjects or courses. By providing access to basic profile information and study availability, the platform facilitates peer matching based on shared academic interests and goals.

A core component of StudyBuddy is the study streak feature, which records and displays consecutive days of study activity. This feature is designed to promote positive study behaviour, encourage accountability, and reinforce consistency through visual feedback rather than competitive ranking.

The project aligns with the theme of sharing and community exchange by focusing on the exchange of time, support, and academic collaboration rather than financial transactions. StudyBuddy aims to foster a supportive learning environment that enhances student wellbeing and academic performance.

Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the StudyBuddy system are to:

Support students in identifying and connecting with compatible study partners

Encourage consistent study habits through non-competitive motivation mechanisms

Reduce feelings of isolation by promoting peer-to-peer academic interaction

Provide a scalable platform that supports subject-based and course-based matching

Demonstrate the application of software engineering principles in a collaborative team environment

Key Functional Features

User registration and authentication

Subject and course browsing

Viewing study buddy profiles

Matching students based on academic criteria and availability

Tracking and displaying individual study streaks

Software Development Methodology

The project is developed using a Scrum-based agile methodology, structured across four iterative sprints. Each sprint focuses on incremental delivery, continuous feedback, and refinement of requirements.

Project planning, task allocation, and progress tracking are managed using a GitHub Project Kanban board, ensuring transparency and accountability among team members. Sprint reviews and regular meetings are used to assess progress and adapt the project scope where necessary.

Running the Project Locally

To run the application in a local development environment:

Clone the repository from GitHub

Ensure Docker is installed and running on the system

Execute the Docker Compose command to build and start the containers

Access the web application via a browser at the configured local port

Docker is used to ensure a consistent development environment across all team members.

Repository Structure

The repository follows a standard Express.js application architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

routes/ – application routing and request handling

views/ – PUG templates for server-side rendering

public/ – static assets including CSS and client-side scripts

Docker configuration files for environment consistency and deployment
